## The state machine API

The API for the state machine is in the
[com.webotech.statemachine.api](../src/main/java/com/webotech/statemachine/api) package. Here you
will find the interfaces that define
the [StateMachine](../src/main/java/com/webotech/statemachine/api/StateMachine.java) and related
objects. Everything in the package has comprehensive javadocs to remind you how things work while
you are coding.
